    /* CRITERIA
     * Get models from Resource.Load blah blah blah
     * In game UI eg speed measure/HUD
     * Pooling system eg bullets or asteroids
     * Space mining and combat Raycasting x2 mining or rangefinder
     * Your game must also use shaders that manipulates textures
     * In world UI
     * Exception handling - if Andrew messes with code, no errors
     * Log errors to file
     * Level of detail for meshes - eg closer to asteroids, becomes more detailed
     * Caustics and refraction shaders - caustics = sunflare heat? or half grass/ice planet where ice crystals refracts on grass?
     * x2 screenshots of breakpoints and physics debugger
     * Shaders on surface of objects
     * 
     * Change Settings Menu:
     * Resolution
     * Colour depth buffer
     * Anti-aliasing
     * point, bilinear, trilinear buffering

    /* Game ideas
     * Story eg: player's ship gets blown up by space pirates and is left alone floating through space. Find the pirates ship and blow it up.

    /* MECHANICS
     * Robo Fly pulls Frog along with robo thruster wings
     * Mouse movement 
     * Left Shift to give speed boost - also apply boost particle/shader
